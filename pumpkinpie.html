    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>After many years of experimentation, I've finally perfected what I think is the ideal formula for a rich pumpkin pie that's also much less likely to crack on top. Serve garnished with whipped cream and freshly grated nutmeg.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>3 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon Chinese 5-spice powder</li>
        <li>1 9-inch unbaked pie crust (see footnote for recipe link)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk together pumpkin puree, egg yolks, and egg in a large bowl until smooth. Add sweetened condensed milk, cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg, and Chinese 5-spice powder; whisk until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Fit pie crust in a 9-inch pie plate and crimp edges.</li>
        <li>Pour filling into the pie shell and lightly tap on the work surface to release any air bubbles.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until just set in the middle, 30 to 40 more minutes. A paring knife inserted into the filling, 1 inch from the crust, should come out clean. Allow to cool completely before serving.</li>
    </ol>
