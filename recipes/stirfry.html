    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I like to serve this broccoli and tofu stir fry over white rice. If you don't have cashews, pecans or almonds will work as well.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon peanut oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li> 
        <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and sliced into strips</li>
        <li>â…“ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dry sherry</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>8 ounces extra firm tofu, diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cashew pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in garlic and cook for a few seconds until it begins to brown. Add the bell pepper and broccoli; cook until the pepper begins to brown and soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir together the chicken broth, soy sauce, sherry, and cornstarch until dissolved. Pour the sauce into the wok and bring to a boil. Stir in the tofu, and cook until hot, about 1 minute. Garnish with cashew pieces to serve.
